# UI-Team Hackathon

## Description
ElderFit is the result of a web design challenge.  The designers created a target user and then designed a fitness app with this user in mind.  The developers then had a few hours to create a HTML/CSS static comp of the wire frame.  Snapshots of the original design and resulting comp are included below.  

This project is part of the Front End Engineering Program at the Turing School of Software Design.  You can find specs for it at http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ux-ui-team-hackathon.html
